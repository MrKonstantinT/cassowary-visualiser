# About
This project is a shape drawing window whose intention is to be used to visualise the output from the [Cassowary](https://constraints.cs.washington.edu/solvers/cassowary-tochi.pdf) constraints solver. The project is powered by the [GtkDrawingArea](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkDrawingArea.html) and [cairo_t](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-cairo-t.html).
